When trying to commit multiple files we need to keep track of where they are,
and if you want to create multiple commits do this mulitple times.
In gitcommit, you have an interactive cli tool where you can tag files and
each is associated with a seperate commit.`,

	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
